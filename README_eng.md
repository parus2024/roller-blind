## üåü Project Description

**Roller-Blind** is an intelligent roller blind control system based on ESPHome and integrated with Home Assistant. The project enables automatic control of the blind depending on the time of day, sun position, or user settings, with support for power-saving deep sleep mode. It is ideal for smart homes, providing comfort, safety, and energy efficiency.

Key features:
- **Automatic control**: The blind opens/closes on schedule (time of day) or according to the sun‚Äôs position (sunrise/sunset).
- **Manual control**: Via button, IR remote, or Home Assistant.
- **Power saving**: ESP32-C3 deep sleep with wake-up by timer or button.
- **Safety**: Motor overheat and timeout protection.
- **Monitoring**: OLED display shows status, battery, time, and wake-up reasons.
- **Integration**: Full compatibility with Home Assistant for remote control and monitoring.

The project is based on ESP32-C3, a stepper motor with A4988 driver, and various sensors. The code is written in ESPHome YAML using substitutions for flexible configuration.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Automation
- **‚ÄúSun‚Äù mode**: The blind follows sunrise and sunset with configurable sun angle offset.
- **‚ÄúTime‚Äù mode**: User-defined open and close times (e.g., 07:00‚Äì18:00).
- **Auto/Manual mode**: Enable or disable automatic control.
- **Deep sleep**: The ESP32 sleeps until the next event, saving battery.

### Control
- **Physical button**: Multifunctional (open/close, stop, sleep, info, learning).
- **IR remote (LG)**: Commands UP, DOWN, STOP.
- **Home Assistant**: Full control via MQTT/API (open, close, position).
- **Learning**: Calibration of blind endpoints (open/closed).

### Safety and Monitoring
- **Fuse**: Current monitoring (INA226) and timeouts to prevent overheating.
- **Reed switch**: Position sensor (for stopping when closed).
- **RTC DS1307**: Accurate time even without Wi-Fi.
- **OLED display**: Status info, battery level, sleep timer, and wake-up reasons.
- **Boot log**: History of wake-up causes (timer, button, etc.).

### Power Saving
- Battery powered (18650) with voltage monitoring.
- Deep sleep with wake-up by timer or GPIO.
- Wi-Fi enabled only when needed.

## üìã Installation and Setup

### 1. Prepare Hardware
- Assemble the circuit according to the GPIO wiring above using the schematic.
- Install ESPHome firmware on ESP32-C3 (via USB or OTA).
- Connect the battery and test power supply.

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/roller-blind.git
cd roller-blind
```

### 3. Configure ESPHome
- Open `roller-blind.yaml` in VS Code with ESPHome extension.
- Edit substitutions at the top of the file to match your setup:
  ```yaml
  substitutions:
    name: roller-blind2
    friendly_name: roller-blind2
    friendly_name_short: roller_blind2
    version: "04.10.2025"
    device_ip: 192.168.x.x  # Your IP
    # ... other parameters (GPIO, speeds, etc.)
  ```
- Upload the `arial.ttf` font file to the project folder (or specify path).

### 4. Integrate with Home Assistant
- Add device via MQTT discovery in Home Assistant.
- Use entities: cover, sensors, switches, buttons.
- Example automation: ‚ÄúOpen blind at sunrise.‚Äù

### 5. Blind Learning Mode
- Enable learning mode by long-pressing the button for 6‚Äì10 seconds.
- Follow on-screen instructions: close the blind, press button at bottom position, then open and press at top position.
