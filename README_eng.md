## üåü Project Description

**Smart-Roller-Blind** is an intelligent roller blind (curtain) control system built on ESPHome and integrated with Home Assistant. The project allows automatic and manual control of the blind depending on the time of day, sun position, or user settings, with support for energy-saving deep sleep mode. Perfect for smart homes, providing comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. Without recharging, it provides autonomous operation for 1-2 months with daily use. By replacing the stepper motor with a driver with more powerful options, it can work with heavy curtains.

Main features:
- **Automatic control**: The blind is controlled by schedule (time input) or by sun position (sunrise/sunset), always maintaining the desired state.
- **Manual control**: Via button, IR remote, Home Assistant, Yandex (Alice), Web page.
- **Energy saving**: Deep sleep of ESP32-C3 with wake-up by timer or button.
- **Safety**: Motor overheat protection and timeouts.
- **Monitoring**: OLED display shows status, battery, time, and wake-up reasons.
- **Integration**: Full compatibility with Home Assistant for remote control and monitoring.

The project is based on ESP32-C3 (or any ESP32), stepper motor with A4988 driver, and various sensors. The code is written in ESPHome YAML using substitutions for flexible configuration.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Automation
- **"Sun" mode**: The blind works according to sunrise and sunset (with adjustable sun angle offset).
- **"Time" mode**: Set opening and closing times (e.g., 07:00‚Äì18:00).
- **Auto/Manual mode**: Enable/disable automatic control. In manual mode, controls the blind only on timer wake-up.
- **Deep sleep**: ESP32 sleeps until the next event, saving battery.
- **Auto-correction**: Ability to correct blind position by reed switch on opening.

### Control
- **Physical button**: Multifunctional (open/close, stop, sleep, help, learning).
- **IR remote**: Programmable for any code on any IR remote.
- **Home Assistant**: Full control via API (open, close, position).
- **Yandex (Alice)**: When connected via Home Assistant (open, close, position).
- **Web page**: Remote control from anywhere via any browser at the device's IP address.
- **Learning**: Calibration of blind end points (open/closed).

### Safety and Monitoring
- **Protector**: Current monitoring (INA226) and timeouts to prevent overheating.
- **Reed switch**: Position sensor (for stopping on closing).
- **RTC DS1307**: Accurate time even without Wi-Fi.
- **OLED display**: Information on status, battery, time to sleep, and wake-up reasons.
- **Boot log**: History of wake-up reasons (timer, button, etc.).
- **ESP info**: Information about ESP (reboot reason, free memory, etc.).

### Energy Saving
- Battery power (18650) with voltage monitoring.
- Deep Sleep with wake-up by timer or GPIO.
- Wi-Fi turns on only when necessary.

## üìã Installation and Setup

### 1. Hardware Preparation
- Assemble the circuit according to the GPIO above, using the electrical schematic.
- Install ESPHome on ESP32-C3 (via USB or OTA).
- Connect the battery and test the power.

### 2. Repository Cloning
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/roller-blind.git
cd roller-blind
```

### 3. ESPHome Configuration
- Open the `roller-blind.yaml` file in VS Code with ESPHome extension or in ESPHome Builder.
- Change substitutions at the beginning of the file to your configuration:
  ```yaml
  substitutions:
    name: smart-roller-blind
    friendly_name: Smart Roller Blind
    friendly_name_short: smart_roller_blind
    version: "05.10.2025"
    device_ip: 192.168.x.x  # Your IP
    # ... other parameters (GPIO, speeds, etc.)
  ```
- Load the necessary include folders (and specify the path) or create your own basic entries for the ESPHome project.
- Load the font `arial.ttf` into the project folder (and specify the path).

### 4. Home Assistant Integration
